 Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-retail-data-in-python
This repository contains my work on a Coursera Guided Project, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python on transaction data of a UK-based registered non-store online retail business. The dataset includes transactions from December 1, 2010, to December 9, 2011.

Countries with the highest sales outside the UK

Top customers by revenue

Sales trends over time

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn
